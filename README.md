# CryptoMind

CryptoMind is a full stack application that allows the user to invest in a fictional cryptocurrency recreationally. The incentive behind this project was to familiarize myself with blockchain concepts such as chain validation, proof of work, difficulty and the nonce value by applying those in blockchain objects in the backend in a test-driven manner.

The site is not fully functional and is work under progress.
